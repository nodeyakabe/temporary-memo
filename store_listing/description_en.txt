Why "Temporary Memo"?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Modern memo apps focus on "permanent storage" of information.
But not all information needs to be kept long-term.

"Information I only need today"
"Information that becomes unnecessary in a few hours"
"Temporary information I don't want to keep"

For such "information that should disappear,"
Temporary Memo was created.

Automatically deleted when the deadline comes.
No worries about it remaining, so you can write with peace of mind.

That's the concept of Temporary Memo.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
From the Developer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"I want to save memos, but I don't want them to remain."
This app was created to address this contradictory feeling.

Simple, easy to use, and secure.
I hope this app helps with your temporary information management.
